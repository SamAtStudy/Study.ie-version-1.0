                <p>When we think of learning, we should look at it as something that is of benefit to others along with the benefit it brings to us personally. There is little or no value in learning something only for yourself as  its commonly stated that one of the great joys in learning is the ability to teach.</p>

                <p>I was driven to start Study.ie in 2017, after failing to find a peer-reviewed Spanish course in Valencia. After searching through Google and sifting through offerings I was overwhelmed by all of the different website designs and content layouts. I was looking for a recommendation from a peer similar to the way I would find a hotel based on user reviews and that was nowhere to be found. So we started Study.ie.</p>

                <p>With our startup we believe we can really make it easier for people to know what to do when it comes to learning something new or developing some sort of skill. Imagine a website you can go to and see all the different things other people are learning along with learning resources that have been recommended all in one place, that is what Study.ie will be. </p>

                <p>The idea of learning to code is daunting task. As the need for countries to churn out as many computer scientists and engineers as possible grows so does the amount of free information available for the curious “beginner”.</p>
